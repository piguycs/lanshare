My next goal would be to work on protoipc in some way.

Maybe not the "original" idea that I had for this, but I need to get the daemon
and the client to communicate for any sort of debugging to happen

I also need to figure out how I would test this, as I do need 3 seperate systems
for this to work...

maybe I should get started with basic unit tests and worry about integration
tests later
